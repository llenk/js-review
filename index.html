        Teaching Methodology
    </h1>
    <h3>Read. Write. Speak. Teach.</h3>
    <h4>Read.</h4>
    <p>Start doing this.</p>
    <h4>Write.</h4>
    <p>Quickly move to this, helps you figure it out.</p>
    <h4>Speak</h4>
    <h4>Teach</h4>
    <p>These two flow together, and are super helpful. Talk about the code. </p>
    <h1>Group Projects</h1>
    <p>Don't try to go faster. If you're behind your group, ask. Use right words. Goal is not speed. Everyone on team should understand. Goal is to <b>learn</b>.</p>
